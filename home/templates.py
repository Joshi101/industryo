Template_LSI_all = u'''<div dir="ltr"><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">Hi {0}</font><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">As this year is approaching to its end, we would like to tell you what <b><a href="http://www.corelogs.com" target="_blank">CoreLogs</a></b> is all about and how we plan to revolutionize the world of Engineering.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">It all started with an idea. We launched the platform for small &amp; medium scale industries only. Very soon we realized that a platform for small scale industry owners is incomplete and actually not so useful without the involvement of engineers from large scale industries. So we modified it to get people like you to the platform.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">The idea is that the people from SMEs do know about their field but they lack a complete awareness with the world of engineering and the recent developments. We think that if we get the Engineers from large Scale industries like you on the website, actively participating in the discussions and proactively helping people from SMEs, we can actually develop a great community of engineers and industrialists who would help each other and thereby boosting the growth of core segment of engineering.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">But why do we (Engineers from large industries) need to help small industries? I think the better question would be how can we help them? The SMEs are not too organized, not having too much revenues to spare on highly paid consultants and not having enough resources to spend on marketing. Under these circumstances they are left with very few options to expand and improve. With the help of you and people like you, they can hope to get their technical problem solved for free. And not only SMEs but also other engineers you can help too.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">Although, we accept that this kind of community would take time to evolve and actually be helpful to people but we firmly believe that sooner or later, it will. We firmly believe that through persistent efforts and a little support and involvement from people like you, we will be able to create a great community. A community which will revolutionize the field of manufacturing and engineering. A community that SME owners and engineers will depend upon and appreciate. And a community that you will be proud to be a part of.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">With these words, we once again request you to invite a few friends from your company to <b><a href="http://www.corelogs.com" target="_blank">www.corelogs.com</a></b>. We wish you a very Happy New Year.</font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">Thanks</font></div><div><div><div><div dir="ltr"><div><b><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif">--<br>Surya Prakash.<br>Founder</font></b></div><div><font size="4" face="arial narrow, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.corelogs.com" target="_blank"><b>CoreLogs</b></a><br></font><div class="yj6qo"></div><div class="adL"><br></div></div></div></div></div><div class="adL">

Template_Team_all = u'''<div dir="ltr"><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">Hi {0},</font><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">The Year is approaching its end. We just witnessed a very great facebook event #CaptureYourTeam. The event was good. Team GVA Motorsports won the competition. The bigger implication was that the people from formula / Baja/ Aero Design Efficycle and other teams can together be brought to one common platform to build a community.</font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">We have recieved many mail from people of various teams that they love <b><a href="http://www.corelogs.com/forum" target="_blank">The Engineers Forum</a></b> on CoreLogs. It has been great motivation for us. But as you might have seen that not too many people answer the Questions. I believe that most of you know the answers. I hope that in few months you people will accept CoreLogs as a standard forum and would &nbsp;be proud to write answers and ask questions. The problem with the traditional forums as you might have seen is that they don't welcome amateur level questions and often times the on who asks has to face embarrassment. We believe that it is a wrong tradition and CoreLogs is here to stop all that.</font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">Another point I want to raise is the tradition of making team websites. We have seen teams spending their money that they collect through sponsorship (much pain) on making team websites. Just imagine if somebody comes to you asks for Rs 10k and tells you that he will make a website of your name. We would think that it's not necessary as we have facebook profile and linkedin profiles. Those are the profile of a person on a connected environment. So is CoreLogs for your team. I would request you to think about it and concentrate upon the team profile on corelogs instead of an independent website among millions of websites out there.</font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">Right now, we are working hard to get Small manufacturers and sellers to the platform and list their products. That also includes Safety equipment, some components like hydraullic pressure switches, machined items and on demand machining and manufacturing services. We hope that CoreLogs becomes a good platform for them to connect with their consumers that is you people. We won't be involved in transactions. Our only aim will be to bring both of you to the same platform and open up more competitive pricing for automobile parts like dampers tyres and all.</font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">I would thank you people for being a part of our journey in 2015 and wish you a Happy New Year. We &nbsp;hope to expand fast in 2016 and hope that we have your blessings. Keep connected. let's Grow together.</font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">Thanks<br clear="all"></font><div><div><div dir="ltr"><div><b><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4">--<br>Surya Prakash.<br>Founder</font></b></div><div><font face="arial narrow, sans-serif" size="4"><a href="http://www.corelogs.com" target="_blank"><b>CoreLogs</b></a><br></font><div class="yj6qo"></div><div class="adL"><br></div></div></div></div></div><div class="adL">
